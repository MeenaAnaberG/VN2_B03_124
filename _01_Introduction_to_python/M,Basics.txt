copy-
 create bindings between a target and an object
1.deep copy- 
	any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.
	 In python, this is implemented using “deepcopy()” function
2.shallow copy-
	any changes made to a copy of object do reflect in the original object.
	 In python, this is implemented using “copy()” function.


# importing copy module
import copy

li1 = [1, 2, [3,5], 4]


# using copy for shallow copy
li2 = copy.copy(li1)

# using deepcopy for deepcopy
li3 = copy.deepcopy(li1)


TRY,CATCH blocks:

The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
The except block lets you handle the error.
The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.


try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")


try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")


try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")
