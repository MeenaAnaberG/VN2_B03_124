if ,else,elif ,for,while:

1  while loop
		Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. 
It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

2  for loop
	Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

3  nested loops
	You can use one or more loop inside any another while, 
for or do..while loop.




1.while:
	A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

   Syntax:
		The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is âˆ’

			while expression:
			 statement(s)

	Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. 
	The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value.
 	The loop iterates while the condition is true.


2.For:
	A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

	This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, 
	and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
	With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

		fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
		for x in fruits:
		  print(x)

3.Nested:

	if,elif,else
	
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
